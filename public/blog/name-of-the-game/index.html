<p>It goes without saying, that anything that's exposed to the internet comes with risks. I think most people would be surprised to know just how much risk that is though! I also believe that people would crap their pants if they knew how their personal data is being handled and used by these services. And to add a cherry on top of this steaming pile, a fair amount of these apps and services are developed by people who learned by watching YouTube tutorials while reading Get-Rich-Fast-Yolo™️ whilst vaping. Another big amount of these apps are developed by people using words and phrases like "Circle back", "Alignment", "Key Point Indicators for Risk Mitigation" and other hellish variations of LinkedIndish.</p>
<p>I once read this on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hackers don't give a fuck if you're ISO 27001" certified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ISO 27001 is a great framework and so is NIS2 (For getting started), but damn that's a great oneliner.</p>
<p>I have deployed my fair share of web apps over the last 10 years. A good amount of services as a private person but more than half as a freelancer with my own business. Admittedly, 80% Wordpress websites, but I have also deployed servers, setup domains, email, fiddled with DNS, surveillance equipment and much more.</p>
<p>I've had one Wordpress site defaced due to a address auto-complete plugin that without warning was suddenly not maintained anymore and became exploitable. Another site was suddenly flooded with spam, even though comments were disabled, but a bad plugin had a vulnerability.</p>
<p>The first time I deployed my own server was during my study and we were instructed to disable password security and enable SSL logon for the SSH service. I missed this step and within 12 hours my server was shut down by the hosting provider due to massive abuse from bots originating from russian based IP addresses.</p>
<p>Recently I deployed a Laravel app for a side-hustle and within 24 hours it was crawled by AI bots and scanned multiple times for misconfigurations by bots. I've done my best to harden the app and encrypted the complete database. Sure some queries might take some extra miliseconds but it helps me sleep at night.</p>
<p>Do you trust the companies that store data about you?</p>
