It’s a truth universally acknowledged that anything exposed to the internet carries risk—and most of us would be horrified to learn just how much. Seriously, if you knew how much of your personal data is floating around, you’d probably need new pants.

To make matters more… interesting, a decent chunk of apps and services out there were thrown together by folks who learned to code through late-night YouTube tutorials, fueled by Get-Rich-Fast-Yolo™ ebooks and copious vaping breaks. The rest? They’re corporate creations brimming with buzzwords like “circle back,” “alignment,” “Key Point Indicators for Risk Mitigation” and other LinkedIndish variations.

Over the past decade I’ve launched my fair share of web projects—mostly WordPress sites (80%, if I’m being honest), but also custom servers, domains, email setups, DNS tweaks, surveillance gear, you name it. And I’ve earned my scars:

- Plugin Apocalypse  
One day, an auto-complete plugin on a WordPress site went unmaintained and—bam—defaced homepage. No warning, just one moment “search for blog posts,” the next “Welcome to Hacker Central.”

- Spam Armageddon
  Another site got slammed by spam bots, even with comments disabled—courtesy of a vulnerable plugin that should have retired gracefully but instead gaped open like a digital buffet.

- Rookie VPS Move
  My first VPS: I forgot to disable password logins for SSH and failed to enable key-based authentication. Eight hours later, the host pulled the plug after Russian bots turned my server into a proxy farm.

- Laravel Under Siege
  Just last month I launched a Laravel side-hustle. By day two, AI bots had crawled every endpoint and probed for misconfigurations. I tightened everything, encrypted the entire database—and yes, some queries now take an extra few milliseconds. But hey, I sleep like a baby.

Do you trust the companies hoarding data about you? Because if you knew what goes on behind the scenes, you might sleep with one eye open.
